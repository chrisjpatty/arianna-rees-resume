  Co-founder, author, and site administrator for a self-run publication called
  Mormon Buzzz. I create content, edit all articles before publication, and
  write news, feature stories, and opinions pieces relating to Mormonism and
  issues that affect Mormons. My Mormon Buzzz pieces are frequently republished
  on other websites, including an article I wrote about Lindsey Stirling, which
  was picked up by the Deseret News.
