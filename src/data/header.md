biography: >-
  Hi, there! My name's Arianna, and I'm a Utah State graduate with over nine
  years of editing/copywriting experience. I've edited two literary magazines,
  two yearbooks, and spent two years as a news reporter for my collegiate
  newspaper. Currently, I manage social media and plan events for a local
  sporting goods store. My background is in journalism and creative writing, but
  I'm a well-rounded individual with experience in multiple fields.
